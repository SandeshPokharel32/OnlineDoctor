The Health Care project is going to be solely implemented for patients and web admin. In detail, the main function of the system is to register and store patients detailed medical record. Patient will be able to access their medical history at the click of a button. They can book an appointment specific to their problem through the web app. Patient can also contact doctor’s office seeking any information, refill prescription, request diagnosis report and suggestion on their current medical condition through email. Whenever notification is required to remind important dates/time to patient only email will be used and where money comes into the picture, the system checks the patient’s insurance first to help them save money. Administrator must have to register and sign up through special permission to access all modules available on the web. Administrator can verify the authentication of doctor and pharmacist before serving on the system.
